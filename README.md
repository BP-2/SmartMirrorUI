# Welcome  ðŸ‘‹

This Repo contains code for my smart mirror display weekend project.  

The UI includes...

1. Greeting.
2. Clock.
3. Weather forecast via NOAA API. This includes chart visualizations of temperature and precipitation forecasts.

### Snapshot of interface. Styling is simple as smart mirror's require high contrast to be visible. ###
